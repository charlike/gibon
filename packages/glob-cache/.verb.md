### [globCache](./src/index.js#L46)

Match files and folders using glob patterns. Returns a resolved Promise containing
a `{ results, cacache }` object - where `results` is an array of [Context](#context-and-how-it-works) objects
and `cacache` is the [cacache][] package.

**Signature**

```ts
function(options)
```

**Params**

- `options.include` **{Array&lt;string&gt;}** - string or array of string glob patterns
- `options.exclude` **{string}** - ignore patterns
- `options.always` **{boolean}** - a boolean that makes `options.hook` to always be called
- `options.hook` **{Function}** - a hook function passed with [Context](#context-and-how-it-works)
- `options.glob` **{Function}** - a globbing library like [glob][], [fast-glob][], [tiny-glob][], defaults to `fast-glob`
- `options.globOptions` **{object}** - options passed to the `options.glob` library
- `options.cacheLocation` **{string}** - a filepath location of the cache, defaults to `./.cache/glob-cache`
- `returns` **{Promise}**

**Example**

```js
const tinyGlob = require('tiny-glob');
const glob = require('glob-cache');

glob({ include: 'src/*.js', glob: tinyGlob }).then(({ results }) => {
  console.log(results);
});
```

## Context and how it works

Each context contains a `{ file, cacheFile, cacheLocation, cacache }` and more properties.
The `file` one represents the fresh file loaded from the system, the `cacheFile` represents the
file from the cache. Both has `path`, `size` and `integrity` properties, plus more.

The `cacheFile` can be `null` if it's the first hit (not found in cache),
in such case the `ctx.missing` will be `true` and on next runs this will be `false`.

Important to note is that `cacheFile` don't have a `contents` property, but has `path`
which points to the place of the cache file on the disk.

The interesting one is the `ctx.valid`. This one is the reason for the whole existance
of this module. If both the "source" file and cache file are the same,
e.g. same size and integrity (which means the contents/shasum are equal),
then `ctx.valid: true`, otherwise this will be `false`. Simply said, when you change your file(s)
matched by a the given glob pattern(s), then it will be `valid: false` and the `options.hook` will
be called.

There is also one more key point, and it's in the `options`. We have `options.hook` and
`options.always`. By default we only call the `options.hook` when `valid: false` which is
important and intentional, because most of the time you only want to do or run something
when there are actual changes in the files, right? But there are also a cases when you want
more control, that's why we have `options.always` option which bypass the previous validation
and so the `options.hook` will always be called and so you can decide what to do or
make more additional checks - for example, listen the `mtime` - or track the dependencies
of the file. Tracking dependencies is something that some test runner may benefit.

Because all that, we also expose `cacache` to that `options.hook`,
so you can update or clean the cache - it's up to you.

Example `results` array with context (which is also passed to `options.hook`):

```

    },
    cacheFile: null,
    cacheLocation: '/home/charlike/github/tunnckoCore/opensource/packages/glob-cache/test/fixture-cache',
    cacache: { /* cacache instance */ },
    valid: true,
    missing: true
  },
  {
    file: {
      path: '/home/charlike/github/tunnckoCore/opensource/packages/glob-cache/src/index.js',
      contents: <Buffer 2f 2a 20 65 73 6c 69 6e 74 2d 64 69 73 61 62 6c 65 20 6e 6f 2d 70 61 72 61 6d 2d 72 65 61 73 73 69 67 6e 20 2a 2f 0a 0a 27 75 73 65 20 73 74 72 69 63 ... 5268 more bytes>,
      size: 5318,
      integrity: 'sha512-946V9t8jWq6oGdAVnrl206b077+Ejl0VFn/MK1axZdsFyvzGrT+MfzH2aVQOUPMcp8jm5tZvES7A1XXEsRvZ9w=='
    },
    cacheFile: null,
    cacheLocation: '/home/charlike/github/tunnckoCore/opensource/packages/glob-cache/test/fixture-cache',
    cacache: { /* cacache instance */ },
    valid: true,
    missing: true
  }
]
```

One more thing to clarify. When there is no cache, e.g. the state is "missing",
and if you look over the code you'll see that the `valid` is
hard-coded/forced to be `true`. You may expect the hook to be called in the first run
but it will not. For that behavior you should use the `always: true`.
